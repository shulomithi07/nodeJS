- We haev sync and async method to write file with fs module
- fs.writefile("filename") --> this if for async call
- fs.writeFileSync("filename) --> thist is foer async call

## APPEND
- We haev sync and async method to read file with fs module
- fs.appendedfile("filename") --> this if for async call
- fs.appendedFileSync("filename) --> thist is foer async call

## RENAME
- We haev sync and async method to read file with fs module
- fs.renamefile("filename") --> this if for async call
- fs.renameFileSync("filename) --> thist is foer async call

## DELETE
