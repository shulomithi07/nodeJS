# Array Methods
    Array is like a container which can store more than one thing. So it a variable which can store multiple values.

## Create an array
    Arrays can be created in two ways either by creating and assigning it to a variable
    Or by using a constructor to create and assign the data.

## PUSH
    It is used to insert an element at the end of an array.

## POP
    It is used to remove an element at the end of an array.

## SHIFT
    It is used to remove an element at the begining of an array.

## UNSHIFT
    It is used to insert an element at the begining of an array.

## REVERSE
    It is used to reverse the order of the array, First becomes last and last becomes First.

## SORT
    It is used to sort the elements in terms of their occurences.

## SPLICE
    It can be used in 2 ways you can add the elements by specifing the index and the data, and also you can just give the index to delete the data from the array

## CONCAT
    IT is used to concatenate 2 arrays it will join them and result in the array which is a combination of both the arrays

## INDEXOF
    It is used to get the first index of the element passed to it. If the element is not found it will return -1

## LASTINDEXOF
    It is used to get the latest(last) index of the given element to it.

## JOIN
    It is used to join the elements in a string and returning the string

## SLICE
    It is used to get the subarray of an array where you should be providing the the start index and the end index to get the data in between

## EVERY
    It is used to check if all the data, every value in the array follow s the codition

## FILTER 
    It is used to create a new array with the given condition which is usually passerd as face.

## FIND
    It returns the first occurance of the element basing of the client condition

## FIREACH
    'forEach method in arrays is a loop which is used to call a function for each


## reduce()
    reduce() Method in arrays
    reduce method is used to reduce the array to a single value. This method executes the provided function for each value of the array and stores the result in accumulator. Note : It does not execute on array with no values. Snippet is given below :
